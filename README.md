# smart-library-layout

- Full Screen Layout:
  - Header (Top Bar):
    - Occupies the full width and a small proportion of the screen's height, around 60px given standard practices.
    - Background color: a shade of light blue, potentially #00BFFF or a close hexadecimal value.
    - Contains the "SMARTLIBRARY" logo:
      - Aligned to the left with a margin that could be around 20px from the edge, considering common CSS practices.
      - Text characteristics: sans-serif typeface, possibly Arial or Helvetica; bold weight; uppercase letters; the color is white or a very light shade of grey, contrasting with the background.
      - Text size is large, suggesting a font-size of around 24px to 36px for visibility.
    - Search bar:
      - Positioned on the top right, maintaining a consistent margin from the right edge, similar to the logo margin.
      - Size: It's about 200px to 300px in width and 40px in height, with rounded corners of about 5px radius.
      - Inside the search bar, the placeholder text "Search..." is left-aligned and likely the same font as the "SMARTLIBRARY" text but smaller, around 16px.
      - The search bar's styling includes a border, possibly 1px solid #CCCCCC, and a lighter background color than the header, perhaps #F0F0F0.
    - Plus sign (+) icon:
      - Positioned with even spacing to the right of the search bar, ensuring visual balance.
      - The icon is likely a button with a circle background that has a diameter just slightly less than the height of the search bar, implying around 30px to 35px.
      - Icon color and style match the header, suggesting an SVG graphic or a font icon, like FontAwesome, for crisp rendering.

  - Main Content Area:
    - Divided into a left-hand side column and a broader right-hand side section.
    - The background is a gradient or solid pale blue, giving a soft contrast against the elements it contains, which might be #E0FFFF or a similar shade.
    - Left Column:
      - It takes up approximately 1/4th of the screen width.
      - Contains two categories:
        - Each category has a title in a bold sans-serif font, about 18px to 20px in size.
        - Titles have a padding of about 10px from their containers to avoid text clipping and ensure readability.
        - Each item within the categories is a box:
          - Boxes are likely 150px to 200px in width and about 40px in height, with rounded corners of about 3px.
          - The border could be 1px solid with a shade of light blue slightly darker than the sidebar, such as #00CED1.
          - Each box is a clickable element, likely implemented as a button or an anchor link (<a>) with a hover effect that may change the background color to a slightly darker shade for interactive feedback.
    - Right Column:
      - Occupies about 3/4ths of the screen width.
      - Each category box within the grid is a card element:
        - Cards have a consistent width that might be about 300px, with heights varying according to content, ranging from 100px to 250px.
        - They have a margin of around 20px between them, providing enough whitespace for visual separation.
        - The header of each card is in a larger, bold font, approximately 22px, in uppercase, suggesting importance.
        - The list of items within each card are in a smaller font, around 16px, and may have a bullet or icon before them to signify a list item.
        - The "> OPEN" button is consistently placed at the bottom right of each card, with styling likely including a color change on hover to indicate interactivity, with a font size similar to the list items for consistency.

  - Left Sidebar:
    - Extends vertically to match the height of the screen, the width being around 100px based on common sidebar dimensions.
    - Contains navigation icons:
      - Spaced with a consistent margin from the top and bottom edges, approximately 20px.
      - Icons are centered within the sidebar and likely around 40px to 50px in size to be easily clickable/tappable.
      - The bottom icon for the menu is standardized with three horizontal lines, also known as a "hamburger" icon.
